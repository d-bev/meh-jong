Riichi Mahjong but mediocre

# Description
A few of my friends and I enjoy playing Riichi Mahjong, so I decided it would be a good project (and good Python practice) to attempt to code a game so we could play together remotely without having to use other services. Originally, the project was envisioned to just be a bare-bones 4-player tabletop simulator, but I'm going to be forking this into two projects: the standard 3-4 player riichi mahjong, and a single player 'mini mahjong' game I've devised.

Multiplayer code is something that's completely foreign to me, so as of right now the 3-4player mode is going to be played locally.
By this I specifically mean that the program will run on one laptop/pc and players will have to be physically present to take their turns, as Riichi Mahjong Requires 3-4 players, meaning I'd either have to find/create netcode or Bots.

# Specifics and Limitations
I'm attempting to implement the entire project in solely Python, and using Object-Oriented Programming.
Multiplayer will require p2p or something similar.

# Goals

Whenever I feel like I get to an pre-alpha stage with this game, I'm going to do some basic user testing with friends and family. I hope to get a sort of mock-produuction cycle going where I'm treating the project as totally professional.

If I feel as though user testing has gone well, I'll likely try to list it on Steam for free to get some real-world feedback.

# Other Notes
Current code (specifically classes) needs to be refactored such that objects actually have possession over other objects
