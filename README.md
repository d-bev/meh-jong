# meh-jong
Riichi Mahjong but mediocre

# Description
Some of my friends and I enjoy playing Riichi Mahjong, so I decided it would be a good side-project (and good Python practice), to attempt to code a game and API so that we could play together remotely without having to use other services

# Specifics and Limitations
I'm attempting to implement the entire project in solely Python, and using Object-Oriented Programming

Network connectivity will almost certainly have to be Peer-to-Peer: I'm not hosting a server.

# Other Notes
Current code (specifically classes) needs to be refactored such that objects actually have possession over other objects
