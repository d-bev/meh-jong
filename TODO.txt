CURRENT BUGS:


TODO:
    - tests.py
        - there's always room for more tests!
        - add error reporting to each test
        - make test_hand_sorting() actual check that the hand is sorted 
            (currently just tests that the first tile in a hand is the smallest in the hand)

    - Player.py
        - call_tile()
        - force_discard()
        - adjust discard() to pass the discarded tile to DiscardPile

    - Dealer.py
        - implement 3-player tileset checks

    - implement DiscardPile
    - implement DeadWall

    - netcode D:


PLANNING AREA:

    Planned Class/Object Heirarchy:
        Game
            Dealer
                Dead Wall (maybe not an object; probably should be though)
                    Tile
                Tile (redundant?)
            Player
                Discard Pile (maybe not an object; who cares)
                    Tile
                Tile (redundant?)
            Scorer
                Tile
                

    Possible Class Variables:

        Game
            round wind
            players' seats (and scores?)
            streak counter
                
        Dead Wall
            Top Row (to determine dora)
            Bottom Row (to determine ura-dora)
